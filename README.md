## Features
* Individual finger tracking where each finger can affect the pitch.
* Volume and pitch controls.
* Can see frequency/nearest note to help with learning.
* Markings to show user where to place their hand to get the right note.

Currently supports Oculus Quest VR headset.

The nice thing about VR is that you can add 3D markings to indicate where to place the fingers to get a certain note. This makes it possible for even beginners to pick up the theremin much faster in VR. I'm excited to explore how VR can be used to augment how we interact with objects in the real world.

## Future plans
* Add a on/off switch.
* Different environments for player to play in.
* Better model for the theremin.
* Different sounds and customization options.
